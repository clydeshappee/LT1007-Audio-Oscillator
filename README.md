# LT1007-Audio-Oscillator

Here are the files for this oscillator project.  

A couple of notes about it.  I used a linear taper pot for the tuning.  It probably was not the best choice,  as you can see in the photo the frequency
markings are non-linear.  Perhaps an inverse log taper is what is required here.  I had spent $20 on the pot, a good brand name
and wired everything up before I thought about the dial marking.

The capacitors are in pairs and were given to me by my father who had a lot of parts.  He was kind enough to match them on
his GENRAD 1650A impedance bridge.  It is important that the pairs match closely.

I did point to point wiring and once start the design of a PCB, but I stopped.  After over 30 years it is still working
just fine.

I hope that you, the reader enjoy this.

I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.
